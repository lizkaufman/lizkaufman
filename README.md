### Hi there üëã

After working in operations and project management at Boots and in the NHS, I decided to follow my heart toward technology through the intensive School of Code sixteen-week bootcamp to become a software developer. I‚Äôm drawn to technology and development because I‚Äôve always loved learning, challenges, and the occasional leap into the unknown ‚Äì not to mention that coding is the closest thing to magic in real life! Shortly after graduating from the School of Code in May 2020, I had the privilege of joining the SoC team to continue to level up my skills while paying it forward, sharing the magic of code with bootcampers and changing lives.

I chose a career in programming because it keeps me on my toes, developing my skills, and weaving together creativity and logic to solve problems and create new things. I‚Äôm excited to work with and glean knowledge from others within agile teams. I especially enjoy using React and its various libraries to create dynamic, modern, and accessible web applications, and I enjoy hooking up the ‚Äúguts‚Äù of an application across the front end and back end, creating, testing, and implementing components and weaving them together. I've recently fallen in love with C# now as well, and I look forward to learning even more languages and tools as my career progresses.
