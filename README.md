### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After my history and archaeology degree, I worked in operations and project management until I followed my dream to seek a career that was challenging and meaningful and learn to code. I was a bootcamper on School of Code's third cohort from Jan-May 2020, where I became a full-stack developer and discovered that code is the closest thing to magic in real life.

After the bootcamp, I wanted to share that magic with other people, so I became a coach and progressed to lead coach and Head of Bootcamps at the School of Code. It's here that I discovered a love for not just coding but also communicating about tech, and I've used the magic of code to change the lives of over 300 people and counting!
